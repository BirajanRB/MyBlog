                <h1>the Myers-Briggs Test (MBTI) </h1>
                <p>
                    The Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator is a self-report inventory designed to identify a person's personality type, strengths, and preferences.
                    The questionnaire was developed by Isabel Myers and her mother Katherine Briggs based on their work with Carl Jung's theory of personality types. Today, 
                    the MBTI inventory is one of the most widely used psychological instruments in the world. If you want to know more about yourself, 
                    or just need some kind of direction in your life I recommend doing a MBTI personality test to judge your personality type. This will also help you with your career
                    and also with the human relationships you have with the people around you, all while making you understand yourself more.

                <h1>Blue Yeti Microphone</h1>
                <p>
                    The Blue Yeti is absolutely worth it. It comes with three capsules and four polar patterns making it great for streaming, recording, gaming and podcasting.
                    Not to mention it is made by Blue, one of the best in the industry when it comes to microphones. i've been using it for more then 5 years and have had no issues with it yet.
                    the quality of this microphone is good with the co-relation of its value.

                <h1>Redragon K530 Draconic 60% keyboard</h1>
                <p>
                    The Redragon K530 is a budget-friendly 60% mechanical keyboard with Redragon-branded Outemu switches that are easy to swap out with the hot-swappable sockets.
                    The K530 is in a tough race against other 60% keyboards such as the GK61 and Epomaker SK61, but really separates itself with how high-quality and well-thought out the design is.
                    Finding a mechanical that is a 60% layout, with Bluetooth technology and hot-swappable switches all wrapped up in a fantastic build is no easy feat, but the K530 does it very well.
                    This keyboard is perfect for those who enjoy a compact layout that is packed with features.
